                <p>
                    Brigho serves as an intermediary between two or more people who have agreed between and/or among
                    themselves to carry out a financial transaction for the exchange or a good/item. We receive money from
                    the potential Buyer, safe-keep the money in our custody for both the Buyer and the Seller. Only when both
                    the Seller and the Buyer complete the transaction do we send money for the good/item to the Seller.
                    A completed transaction is one in which the Buyer has collected the good/item sent by the Seller.
                    <span class="color-blue-light">
                        For this service we take a small commission of 2.5% on every transaction.
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the transaction cannot be completed between the Seller and the Buyer for whatever reason, money sent by the Buyer to Brigho for the purchase of the good/item is sent back to the Buyers account less the cost of shipping/delivery/transportation (which goes to the Seller) and the commission of 2.5% which goes to Brigho.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brigho thus operates a functional warehousing account through which a Seller and a Buyer not too familiar with one another can successfully transact a business. We provide trust and assurance between two or more unknown parties who are interested in carrying out a transaction thus enabling and encouraging Nigerians to sell their goods/items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a registered company under Nigerian Law of CAMA Act, you can be assured your money is in safe custody and
                </p>
                <p>
                    We protect both the Buyer and the Seller from loss of funds particularly in cases where neither know themselves.

                    Brigho is only liable for money sent to us by our clients and kept in our custody and we can be entrusted with safe-keeping your hard-earned money. We understand that this is not our money but money meant either for the Buyer or/and the Seller. To this end we go to great lengths to ensure these monies are kept in the safest possible way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Brigho is not liable for any good/item being sent or purchased between the Buyer and the Seller. This is particularly so because we do not inspect good/item neither do we transport/ship/deliver items/goods because we are not a haulage company. Liability on all goods/items is left in the hands of the Buyer and the Seller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We therefore advice all Buyers to be completely satisfied with goods/items they receive from a Seller before instructing Brigho to conclude a transaction. Brigho will not refund any money or goods/items after a concluding confirmation has been received from one or both parties.
