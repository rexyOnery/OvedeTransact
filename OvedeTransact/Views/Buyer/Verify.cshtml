                    Before using this App, it is expected that the Buyer and Seller have already agreed on modalities including cost of items/goods, cost of shipping/delivery/transportation, means of transportation and point of collection. Below are the procedures after these above have been agreed.

                            The Seller uses the Brigho app to start the process of the transaction by clicking the PLUS bottom on the Seller’s Dashboard.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Seller inputs his details including Banking details (which will be credited soon as the transaction is completed), his/her phone number (which will be used in communication between all transactional parties); the Buyer’s phone number (which will be used in communication between all transactional parties); the agreed Price of the item/good and the agreed cost of shipping/delivery/transportation.
                        </li>

                            Brigho will instantly send a Transaction Number to the Buyer. The Buyer will use this code to approve the transaction as well as track its status.

                        <li>
                            The Buyer then views the transaction entered by the Seller.

                        <li>
                            If the Buyer is okay with the details of the transaction entered by the Seller, he or she then verifies then accepts the transaction and is immediately redirected to a secured page for payment.

                        <li>
                            After payment in made the Buyer will receive a Delivery Number. This code shall be used only to claim the goods/items.

                        <li>
                            At the point of collecting the goods, the Buyer still has the last option of declining the goods if he or she is dissatisfied with the items/goods. It is extremely important that the Buyer Verifies the Delivery Number at the point of collection. See our ToC&U and FAQ. Both the Buyer and Seller must see to this See our ToC&U.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Should the Buyer be satisfied with the items/goods sent by the Seller, it is expected that the Buyer clicks on the “Satisfied. Pay the Seller” button.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the Delivery Number has been verified and the Buyer has clicked the “Satisfied. Pay the Seller” button, Brigho will pay the money accrued from the transaction straight into the appropriate bank account(s).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Should the Buyer be dissatisfied with the items/goods sent by the Seller, it is expected that the Buyer declines the transaction by clicking on the “Not Satisfied. Please Refund” button

                <p>
                    Brigho serves as an intermediary between two or more people who have agreed between and/or among 
                    themselves to carry out a financial transaction for the exchange or a good/item. We receive money from 
                    the potential Buyer, safe-keep the money in our custody for both the Buyer and the Seller. Only when both 
                    the Seller and the Buyer complete the transaction do we send money for the good/item to the Seller. 
                    A completed transaction is one in which the Buyer has collected the good/item sent by the Seller.
                    <span class="color-blue-light">
                        For this service we take a small commission of 2.5% on every transaction.
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the transaction cannot be completed between the Seller and the Buyer for whatever reason, money sent by the Buyer to Brigho for the purchase of the good/item is sent back to the Buyers account less the cost of shipping/delivery/transportation (which goes to the Seller) and the commission of 2.5% which goes to Brigho.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brigho thus operates a functional warehousing account through which a Seller and a Buyer not too familiar with one another can successfully transact a business. We provide trust and assurance between two or more unknown parties who are interested in carrying out a transaction thus enabling and encouraging Nigerians to sell their goods/items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a registered company under Nigerian Law of CAMA Act, you can be assured your money is in safe custody and
                </p>
                <p>
                    We protect both the Buyer and the Seller from loss of funds particularly in cases where neither know themselves.

                    Brigho is only liable for money sent to us by our clients and kept in our custody and we can be entrusted with safe-keeping your hard-earned money. We understand that this is not our money but money meant either for the Buyer or/and the Seller. To this end we go to great lengths to ensure these monies are kept in the safest possible way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Brigho is not liable for any good/item being sent or purchased between the Buyer and the Seller. This is particularly so because we do not inspect good/item neither do we transport/ship/deliver items/goods because we are not a haulage company. Liability on all goods/items is left in the hands of the Buyer and the Seller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We therefore advice all Buyers to be completely satisfied with goods/items they receive from a Seller before instructing Brigho to conclude a transaction. Brigho will not refund any money or goods/items after a concluding confirmation has been received from one or both parties.
